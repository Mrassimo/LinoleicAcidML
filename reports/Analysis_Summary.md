# Analysis Summary: Linoleic Acid Intake and Health Outcomes in Australia

## 1. Introduction

*   (Placeholder: Briefly state the project goal, the primary research question, and the dataset used.)

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Findings

*   (Placeholder: Summarise key findings from the EDA phase.)
*   **Data Overview:** (Describe dataset structure, time range, key variables)
*   **Summary Statistics:** (Mention key stats, missing data patterns from `eda_summary_statistics.csv`, `eda_missing_data_summary.csv`)
*   **Distributions:** (Describe distributions of key variables based on plots in `figures/distribution_*.png`)
*   **Correlations:** (Discuss key correlations observed in `eda_correlation_matrix.csv` and `figures/eda_correlation_heatmap.png`, especially involving LA intake and health outcomes, including lags.)
*   **Time Trends:** (Refer to initial time-series plots generated earlier, e.g., LA trend, faceted plots)

## 3. Modelling Results

*   (Placeholder: Summarise the results from the different modelling approaches.)
*   **Linear Regression:** (Describe models fitted, key predictors, R-squared values, significant coefficients based on output from `src/models/regression.py`)
*   **Generalised Additive Models (GAMs):** (Describe models fitted, pseudo R-squared, key non-linear relationships identified from PDPs generated by `src/models/gam.py`)
*   **Time-Series Models (Optional):** (If implemented: Describe models fitted, evaluation metrics like RMSE, forecast performance based on output from `src/models/time_series.py`)

## 4. Discussion

*   (Placeholder: Interpret the findings from EDA and modelling in the context of the research question. Discuss consistency or contradictions between different analyses.)

## 5. Limitations

*   (Placeholder: Discuss limitations of the analysis, e.g., ecological fallacy, data quality/availability issues, modelling assumptions, potential confounders not included.)

## 6. Conclusion

*   (Placeholder: Briefly summarise the main conclusions and potential directions for future work.)
