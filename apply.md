`tasks.md` explicitly mentions that the AIHW files were downloaded manually, indicating the automated download process likely failed for them. The Fire in a Bottle data also required manual intervention.

Hereâ€™s a review and plan to ensure the downloads are correct and robust:

**1. Locate the Download Script:**

* First, identify the Python script responsible for handling the downloads. It's often named `src/download_data.py` or similar. This script should ideally read the URLs from `planning.md` (or a config file) and attempt to download them.

**2. Review Each Data Source Download:**

* **NCD-RisC Files (.csv):**
  * URLs: Diabetes, Cholesterol, Adult BMI, Child/Adolescent BMI.
  * Status (`tasks.md`): Most marked [X], Child BMI [-] (Disregarded - empty).
  * **Action/Verification:**
    * Check the download script: Does it use a reliable method like the `requests` library to fetch these URLs?
    * Verify the "empty" Child BMI file: Manually access the URL (`https://ncdrisc.org/downloads/bmi-2024/child_ado/by_country/NCD_RisC_Lancet_2024_BMI_child_adolescent_Australia.csv`). Is the file *actually* empty at the source? Or did the download *fail* and create an empty file locally? If the download failed, fix the script. If it's empty at the source, the "Disregarded" status is correct.
    * Ensure proper error handling exists in the script for CSV downloads (e.g., handling 404 Not Found errors, network issues).
* **AIHW Files (.xlsx):**
  * URLs: Dementia Prevalence, Dementia Mortality, Cardiovascular Disease.
  * Status (`tasks.md`): Marked [X] but  *(Manually downloaded)* .
  * **Problem:** The script likely failed to download these `.xlsx` files automatically.
  * **Action/Verification:**

    * **Enhance Script:** Modify the download script to handle `.xlsx` files. This often requires using `requests` and writing the binary content to a file.
      **Python**

    **Recommendations:**

    1. **Centralize URLs:** Consider putting all URLs in a configuration file (e.g., `config.yaml`) instead of just `planning.md` to make them easier for the script to read.
    2. **Implement Robust Download Logic:** Use the `requests` library with error handling (`try...except`), status code checking (`response.raise_for_status()`), and consider adding `User-Agent` headers for all downloads.
    3. **Automate AIHW & FAOSTAT:** Prioritize fixing the automated download and extraction for the AIHW (`.xlsx`) and FAOSTAT (`.zip`) files.
    4. **Decide on Fire in a Bottle:** Either invest in making the scraping robust or formally adopt the manual workaround and document it.
    5. **Add Logging:** Enhance the download script to log which URL it's trying, where it's saving, and whether it succeeded or failed, including any error messages.
    6. **Update `tasks.md`:** Once downloads are automated, remove the "(Manually downloaded)" notes. Keep the note about the potentially empty Child BMI file if confirmed at the source.
