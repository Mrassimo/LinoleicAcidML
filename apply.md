**Okay, looking at the **analytical_merged_data_with_lags.csv** output, here's an analysis based on the structure and expected data:**

**Observations & Analysis:**

1. **Structure:** The CSV structure looks generally correct. You have:
   * **Year** as the primary index.
   * **Calculated dietary metrics (**Total_LA_Intake_g_per_capita_day**, **LA_Intake_percent_calories**, **Plant_Fat_Ratio**).**
   * **Total macronutrient supply columns (**Total_Calorie_Supply**, **Total_Fat_Supply_g**, **Total_Carb_Supply_g**, **Total_Protein_Supply_g**).**
   * **Placeholders for health outcome metrics (mostly empty in the early years, as expected).**
   * **Lagged **LA_Intake_percent_calories** columns (**LA_perc_kcal_lagX**).**
2. **Years:** The data starts from 1961, which aligns with the availability of FAOSTAT data, providing a good historical baseline for dietary trends.
3. **Dietary Metrics (LA & Plant Fat):**
   * **Total_LA_Intake_g_per_capita_day**: Values start around 21g/day and seem to increase over time (based on later years not shown). This trend direction is plausible.
   * **LA_Intake_percent_calories**: Starts low (~1.6%) and increases. This also seems plausible.
   * **Plant_Fat_Ratio**: Starts around 0.37 and increases. Plausible trend.
4. **Total Supply Metrics (Potential Issue):**
   * **Total_Calorie_Supply**: **These values seem extremely high.** 11,967 kcal/capita/day in 1961 is physiologically impossible for a population average. Typical FAOSTAT values are in the 2500-3500 kcal/day range.
   * **Total_Fat_Supply_g**, **Total_Carb_Supply_g**, **Total_Protein_Supply_g**: These also appear significantly inflated (e.g., 425g fat/day, 1640g carbs/day).
   * **Likely Cause:** The aggregation method used in **src/data_processing/calculate_dietary_metrics.py** (specifically in the **calculate_nutrient_supply** function or how its results are merged/used) might be summing the nutrient values across **all individual food items** listed in the detailed FAOSTAT data, rather than using the pre-calculated 'Grand Total' provided by FAOSTAT for total supply, or ensuring the aggregation doesn't double-count. You need the **overall** per capita supply, not the sum of supplies from every single listed item if those items are already components of broader categories or a grand total.
5. **Health Outcomes:**
   * **The columns are present (**Diabetes_Prevalence_Rate_AgeStandardised**, **Obesity_Prevalence_AgeStandardised**, etc.), but they are mostly empty in the early years shown (1961-1980). This is ** **correct and expected** **, as the NCD-RisC data starts later (around 1980/1990) and the specific AIHW data used starts even later (1980 for CVD mortality, 2009/2010 for the dementia metrics). The data should start appearing in these columns from 1980 onwards.**
   * **Missing Column Check:** I notice **Diabetes_Treatment_Rate_AgeStandardised** is listed in the header but seems to be missing values entirely in the rows shown (just **,,,,**). Double-check if this metric was successfully extracted and merged in **health_outcome_metrics.py** and **merge_health_dietary.py**. It might have been dropped or was unavailable in the source.
6. **Lagged Predictors:**
   * **The lagged columns (**LA_perc_kcal_lagX**) appear correctly structured.**
   * **Values start appearing at the correct year offsets (e.g., **LA_perc_kcal_lag5** starts in 1966, **LA_perc_kcal_lag10** in 1971, etc.).**
   * **The initial **NaN** values (represented by empty strings **,,**) are expected due to the nature of lagging.**

**Summary & Next Steps:**

* **Good:** The overall structure, year range, LA/Plant Fat trends, health column placeholders, and lagged variable generation look correct.
* **Critical Issue:** The total Calorie, Fat, Carb, and Protein supply figures are significantly overestimated. This needs immediate correction as it affects the calculation of **% calories from LA** and the usability of these variables as confounders in your models.
* **Minor Issue:** Investigate the missing **Diabetes_Treatment_Rate_AgeStandardised** data.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Fix Total Supply Calculation:**
   * **Go back to **src/data_processing/calculate_dietary_metrics.py**.**
   * **Modify the **calculate_nutrient_supply** function (or how the data is aggregated before/after calling it).**
   * **Option A (Recommended):** Load the **original** FAOSTAT data (before filtering out broad categories) and explicitly extract the values associated with the 'Grand Total' item (Item Code 2901) for the elements 'Food supply (kcal/capita/day)', 'Fat supply quantity ( g/capita/day **)', and 'Protein supply quantity (** g/capita/day **)'. Use these **directly** as your **Total_Calorie_Supply**, **Total_Fat_Supply_g**, etc. This is the standard way to get overall supply.**
   * **Option B:** If you stick to summing detailed items, ensure you are **only** summing items that are not components of other summed categories to avoid double-counting. This is much harder to get right than using the 'Grand Total'.
   * **Recalculate **Total_Carb_Supply_g** based on the corrected totals.**
   * **Recalculate **LA_Intake_percent_calories** using the corrected **Total_Calorie_Supply**.**
2. **Re-run Processing:**
   * **Run **src/data_processing/calculate_dietary_metrics.py**.**
   * **Run **src/data_processing/merge_health_dietary.py**.**
3. **Investigate Missing Diabetes Treatment Rate:**
   * **Check the output of **src/data_processing/health_outcome_metrics.py** (**health_outcome_metrics.csv**) to see if the column exists there.**
   * **If it's missing there, check the NCD-RisC source file (**ncd_risc_diabetes.csv**) processing within that script. Was the column present? Was the pivot/merge correct?**
   * **If it exists in **health_outcome_metrics.csv** but not the final file, check the merge step in **merge_health_dietary.py**.**
4. **Verify Again:** Once corrected, re-examine the **analytical_merged_data_with_lags.csv** file, paying close attention to the total supply columns to ensure they are in a plausible range (e.g., Calories ~2500-3500).

**The dataset is structurally sound, but the magnitude of the total supply metrics is the key thing to fix before proceeding to modeling.**
