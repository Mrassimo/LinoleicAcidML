Excellent! It sounds like you've made significant progress integrating the changes and even building out the initial visualisation structure. Let's break down the review and then focus on refining those visualisations.

Review of Current State:

Code & Structure:

Configuration (config.py): Looks good. Centralising paths and constants is working well. The addition of ABS URLs/filenames is noted.

Visualisation Module (src/visualisation/): Great job creating a dedicated module! Separating concerns (eda.py, time_series.py, etc.) and having a main.py entry point is excellent practice. Using Pydantic for configuration here too is consistent.

ETL Pipeline (run_etl.py, data_processing/): The pipeline seems robust and successfully generated the final dataset. The fixes for AIHW and FAOSTAT appear effective based on the successful run.

Final Dataset (analytical_data_australia_final.csv): The CSV structure you provided looks correct and aligns with the AnalyticalRecord model. It contains the necessary dietary, health, and lagged LA columns for analysis. The presence of NaNs is expected and normal for this type of merged time-series data.

Testing:

Progress: It's great that most tests are passing after the refactoring and updates. This significantly increases confidence in the ETL pipeline.

AIHW Test Failures: Your diagnosis is spot on:

test_process_aihw_excel: The test likely fails because the minimal Excel file used (test.xlsx with only 'Prevalence' and 'Mortality' sheets lacking the specific structures of S2.4, S3.5, Table 11) doesn't trigger data extraction by either the special handling or the standard processing logic in process_aihw_data.py. Therefore, no records are generated, and the output CSV isn't created (or is empty).

Fix: Modify the test. Either:

Assert that the output file is not created or is empty under these specific test conditions (if that's acceptable behaviour).

Or modify the temp_excel_file fixture to include a sheet that will be processed by the standard logic (e.g., a simple sheet with clear 'Year', 'Rate', 'Sex' headers that doesn't match the special cases).

Or modify process_aihw_excel to always create the output CSV file, even if it's empty (writing just the headers if all_records is empty). This seems like a good approach for consistency.

test_process_sheet_table11: The 'persons' vs 'all' issue is a simple standardisation mismatch. Your code correctly assigns 'persons' (good practice), but the test setup likely expected 'all'.

Fix: Update the assertion in test_process_sheet_table11 to expect 'persons' instead of 'all'.

Generated Visualisations (figures/figures_overview.md):

Overview File: This markdown file is an excellent idea for documenting your visual outputs! It makes it easy to see what's been generated.

Initial Plots: You've generated a good range of initial plots covering EDA, time series, correlation, and basic regression/scatter plots, using the functions in your visualisation module. This confirms the module is working.

Overall: You're in a great position. The ETL is solid, the final dataset is ready, and you have a working visualisation framework. The remaining test issues are minor and fixable.

Refining Visualisations for Impact:

You're right to think critically about which visualisations are most effective. Let's refine the selection and improve their impact, focusing on showing the LA % calories vs. health outcomes over time.

Core Visuals to Select & Enhance (Aim for 3-4 Key Storytelling Plots):

The LA Trend (Lead Visual - Keep & Enhance):

Figure: time_series_LA_Intake_percent_calories_annotated.png

Why: This is the central dietary trend your project focuses on.

Enhancements:

Clearer Title: "Rise in Estimated Linoleic Acid Intake (% Calories) in Australia (1961-2022)"

Annotations: Instead of generic text on the image, use ax.annotate within the plotting code (src/visualisation/time_series.py or a dedicated script in src/analysis/) to point to specific periods or inflection points (e.g., "Start of increase ~1970s", "Plateau/Slight Decline Post-2000?"). Add vertical lines (ax.axvline) for key dietary guideline changes if researched.

Smoothing (Optional): Add a rolling average line (e.g., 5-year) using df[la_col].rolling(5).mean() to smooth out noise and highlight the long-term trend more clearly alongside the raw data.

Juxtaposing Trends (Overlay Plot - Refine or Split):

Figure: overlay_time_series.png (or alternatives)

Why: Directly compares the timing of changes in LA intake and health outcomes.

Refinement Options:

Option A (Dual Axis - Use Cautiously): Plot LA_Intake_percent_calories on the left Y-axis and one key health outcome (e.g., Obesity_Prevalence_AgeStandardised) on the right Y-axis against Year. Crucially, add clear colour-coding and axis labels. State explicitly in the title/caption that axes have different scales (e.g., "Australian LA Intake (% Cals) vs. Obesity Prevalence (%) Over Time"). Repeat for 1-2 other key outcomes (Diabetes, CVD Mort.) as separate plots.

Option B (Standardised Overlay): Standardise (Z-score) the LA and health outcome variables before plotting them on the same Y-axis. This makes comparing the shape of the trends easier, but loses the original units. Title could be "Standardised Trends: LA Intake (% Cals) vs. Key Health Outcomes".

Option C (Faceted Plots): Create a multi-panel plot (e.g., 2x2 grid) using plt.subplots. Plot LA % Cals in the top-left panel, and then Obesity, Diabetes, CVD Mortality in the other panels, all sharing the same X-axis (Year). This avoids dual-axis issues and allows clear comparison of timing.

Lagged Relationship (Scatter Plot - Enhance):

Figure: lagged_scatter_Obesity_Prevalence_AgeStandardised_vs_LA_perc_kcal_lag10_by_decade.png (and similar for other lags/outcomes)

Why: Directly tests the hypothesis that past LA intake relates to current health outcomes. This is likely your most crucial analytical visual.

Enhancements:

Select Key Lags/Outcomes: Choose the most compelling combinations based on EDA/correlation (e.g., maybe 10/15yr lag for Obesity/Diabetes, 15/20yr for CVD). Don't show every possible lag.

Clear Titles: E.g., "Obesity Prevalence vs. 10-Year Lagged LA Intake (% Cals), Coloured by Decade".

Add Correlation/Regression Info: Use scipy.stats.pearsonr or statsmodels to calculate the correlation coefficient (r) and p-value for the linear relationship shown in the regplot. Annotate this directly on the plot (e.g., using ax.text). r=0.XX, p=0.YYY. This adds statistical context.

Consider Faceting: Instead of colouring by decade, you could create separate small scatter plots for different decade ranges (e.g., 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, 2010s) using seaborn.FacetGrid. This can make changes over time even clearer.

Correlation Summary (Heatmap - Keep for Overview):

Figure: correlation_heatmap.png

Why: Provides a quick, dense summary of linear relationships across all variables for the period they overlap.

Enhancements:

Subset Variables: Consider plotting a smaller heatmap focusing only on the lagged LA variables and the key health outcomes for better readability.

Caption: Add a caption explaining that this shows overall correlation and doesn't capture temporal dynamics or non-linearities.

Visualising Machine Learning Results:

You haven't run ML models yet, but here's how you could visualise them later:

Linear Regression/GAMs: As discussed, the regplot and GAM partial dependence plots are the primary visualisations. You can also plot residuals to check model fit.

Tree-Based Models (e.g., XGBoost, RandomForest):

Feature Importance: The most common visualisation. Use model.feature_importances_ and plot as a horizontal bar chart showing which variables (including lagged LA, total calories, year, etc.) were most predictive of a given health outcome. This is visually clear and impactful.

Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs): Libraries like sklearn.inspection.PartialDependenceDisplay can generate PDPs for tree models too, showing the marginal effect of a feature (like LA_perc_kcal_lag15) on the predicted outcome.

Time Series Models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet):

Forecast Plots: Plot the original health outcome time series, the model's fitted values on the historical data, and the forecast into the future with confidence intervals. This shows model performance and projections.

Recommendations for Implementation:

Fix AIHW Tests: Address the two failing tests as described above. Standardise on 'persons'. Ensure process_aihw_excel creates an empty file with headers if no records are extracted.

Create a Dedicated Analysis Script/Notebook: Don't put complex analysis logic directly into src/visualisation/main.py. Create a new script (e.g., src/run_analysis.py or a Jupyter Notebook like notebooks/analysis.ipynb) that:

Loads the final dataset using load_unified_dataset.

Performs any necessary filtering/imputation for specific analyses.

Calls the plotting functions from src/visualisation modules.

Adds specific annotations, titles, and statistical overlays (like correlation coefficients) using matplotlib.pyplot functions directly on the axes returned by the seaborn/visualisation functions.

Select & Refine Key Visuals: Generate the plots suggested above (Annotated LA Trend, Overlay/Faceted Trends, Lagged Scatters with Stats). Choose the 3-4 most compelling ones that tell the core story for your portfolio.

(Future) ML Visualisation: When you implement ML models, use Feature Importance plots and potentially PDPs as the primary visual outputs.

You're very close to the finish line for the data engineering part and have a great dataset to work with! Focus on refining those key visualisations to clearly communicate the temporal relationships.
