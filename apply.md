Okay, I've reviewed the latest version of your project, including the new visualisation module and the updated tests. You've made excellent progress!

Review Summary:

Code Structure & Refinements:

Configuration: The integration of src/config.py across the modules (download_data.py, health_outcome_metrics.py, merge_health_dietary.py, calculate_dietary_metrics.py, semantic_matching.py, scrape_fire_in_bottle.py) is well done and significantly improves maintainability.

Deprecated Code: You've successfully removed the deprecated processing scripts and their tests, streamlining the codebase.

Visualisation Module: The new src/visualisation module is well-structured with separate files for different plot types (eda, time_series, correlation, scatter, regression), a utils.py for common functions, and a main.py entry point. This is a great setup for generating your analytical visuals. The use of Pydantic models for configuration (TimeSeriesConfig, etc.) is consistent and good practice.

Test Updates: Significant effort has gone into updating the tests.

Pydantic v2 compatibility issues (like using @field_validator) seem resolved.

Tests for scraping (test_scrape_fire_in_a_bottle.py) now better reflect the <pre> tag parsing logic and fallbacks.

Tests for FAOSTAT processing (test_process_faostat_fbs.py, test_faostat_validation.py) correctly use the FAOStatRecord model and check the pipeline output.

Semantic matching tests (test_semantic_matching.py) are updated.

Health metrics (test_health_outcome_metrics.py) and merging tests (test_merge_health_dietary.py) look appropriate for the current logic.

AIHW Test Issues: You've correctly identified the remaining failures in test_process_aihw_excel and test_process_sheet_table11.

test_process_aihw_excel: The failure likely stems from the fact that the standard processing logic in process_aihw_data.py might not extract records from every sheet if it doesn't find specific headers or patterns, especially after the special handling logic for S2.4, S3.5, and Table 11 returns early. If no records are extracted from any sheet in the test file (which only contains 'Prevalence' and 'Mortality' sheets without the specific structures targeted by special handling), the output CSV won't be created. This might be acceptable behaviour, but the test needs adjustment to either use a test Excel file that does yield records via standard processing or to assert that no file is created under those specific test conditions.

test_process_sheet_table11: The 'persons' vs 'all' mismatch is a classic standardisation issue. Your process_sheet function explicitly assigns 'persons' for Table 11, while your test likely expects 'all' based on the dummy data setup. You should standardise this – decide whether 'persons' or 'all' is your project standard for aggregated sex data and ensure both the processing code and the test use the same term. 'persons' is often preferred in health data contexts.

Final CSV (analytical_data_australia_final.csv):

The structure you provided matches the AnalyticalRecord model well.

It includes the core dietary metrics, the NCD-RisC/AIHW health outcomes you've processed, and the crucial lagged LA variables.

The completeness issues (e.g., missing Population, BMI, some health outcomes only available for later years) are expected given the data sources and are correctly captured as NaN/None. This is perfectly fine – handling missing data is a standard part of time-series analysis.

Readiness for Analytics:

Excellent! The ETL pipeline is demonstrably producing the target dataset. The structure is suitable for time-series analysis and exploring diet-health relationships.

The remaining test issues are isolated to AIHW processing edge cases/standardisation and don't seem to block the generation of the main dataset components used for the core analysis (FAOSTAT-derived dietary metrics, NCD-RisC metrics, lagged variables).

Next Steps & Analytics Focus:

Fix Remaining Tests (Recommended but not Blocking):

Adjust test_process_aihw_excel to reflect the expected outcome (either data extraction from suitable test sheets or asserting no file creation for the current minimal test sheets).

Standardise the 'persons'/'all' discrepancy between process_aihw_data.py (Table 11 handling) and tests/test_process_aihw_data.py::test_process_sheet_table11. Choose one term ('persons' is likely better) and update both.

Address Manual Data (If Needed for This Analysis): If you intend to use ABS or IHME data now, implement the processing logic (as outlined in planning.md and stubbed in process_abs_ihme_data.py) and integrate it into health_outcome_metrics.py or run_etl.py. Otherwise, you can proceed with the current dataset and add these later.

Analytics & Visualisation (Using the Final CSV):

Load Data: Use src.visualisation.utils.load_unified_dataset() in your analysis notebooks or scripts.

Handle Missing Data: Be mindful of the NaN values. Strategies:

Pairwise Analysis: When comparing two variables (e.g., scatter plot, correlation), automatically exclude rows where either variable is missing for that specific comparison. Pandas/Seaborn often do this by default.

Model Imputation: For regression models requiring complete data, consider imputation techniques (e.g., forward fill, mean/median imputation, or more sophisticated methods like KNNImputer or IterativeImputer from scikit-learn), but apply them cautiously and justify the choice. Often, it's better to filter the dataset to the time range where all required variables for a specific model are present.

Time-Range Filtering: For specific analyses (e.g., modeling obesity vs. lagged LA), filter the DataFrame to the years where both variables are non-null.

Visual Storytelling (Portfolio Focus):

(Lead Visual): Start with a compelling time series plot (plot_time_series) showing LA_Intake_percent_calories from 1961-2022. Annotate the dramatic rise.

(Comparison Visuals): Create multi-panel plots or overlay plots (overlay_time_series) showing LA_Intake_percent_calories alongside key health outcomes like Obesity_Prevalence_AgeStandardised, Diabetes_Prevalence_Rate_AgeStandardised, and CVD_Mortality_Rate_ASMR over their respective available time ranges. This visually juxtaposes the trends.

(Core Hypothesis Visuals): Generate lagged scatter plots (plot_lagged_scatter or seaborn.regplot) for:

Obesity_Prevalence_AgeStandardised vs. LA_perc_kcal_lag10 / LA_perc_kcal_lag15

Diabetes_Prevalence_Rate_AgeStandardised vs. LA_perc_kcal_lag10 / LA_perc_kcal_lag15

CVD_Mortality_Rate_ASMR vs. LA_perc_kcal_lag15 / LA_perc_kcal_lag20

Enhancement: Colour points by decade to see temporal changes in the relationship.

(Contextual Visuals): Show time series of Total_Calorie_Supply, Total_Fat_Supply_g, and Plant_Fat_Ratio to provide dietary context.

(Correlation Summary): Include the correlation heatmap (plot_correlation_heatmap) focusing on correlations between lagged LA variables and health outcomes.

(Advanced Visual - Optional): If you explore GAMs (plot_gam), the partial dependence plots showing the non-linear effect of lagged LA intake on health outcomes can be very insightful and visually distinct.

Execution: Use the functions in your src/visualisation/ modules. You can call them from a Jupyter Notebook or a dedicated analysis script (e.g., src/run_analysis.py).

You've successfully built the data foundation. The final CSV looks good, and the remaining minor test issues shouldn't prevent you from starting the exciting analytics and visualisation phase. Focus on telling a clear story with your plots, highlighting the trends and lagged relationships. Good luck!
